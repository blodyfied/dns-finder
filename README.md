# dns-finder
DNS-Finder is a simple tool that I created that is used to find out the IP and geolocation of a website that you are not sure of its origin.
When you download the dns-finder.sh script, you will need to give it execute permissions.
It is important that you first download a dependency called figlet in order for the script to run correctly. 

You can install it using the following command on Debian/Ubuntu-based distros:

sudo apt install figlet

To give execution permissions to the script we can use the following command:

sudo chmod +x dns-finder
